## What is Threat Dragon?

OWASP Threat Dragon is a tool used to create threat model diagrams and to record possible threats and decide on their
mitigations.

TD is both an online threat modelling web application and a desktop application. It includes system diagramming as well
as a rule engine to auto-generate threats and their mitigations. The focus of TD is on great UX, a powerful rule engine
and alignment with other development lifecycle tools.

The [documentation](http://docs.threatdragon.org) is a good starting point, and there is also a recording of Mike Goodwin
in a [lightning demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6JGcZGFq5o) recorded during the OWASP Open Security Summit in June 2020.

Threat Dragon has a [demonstration page](https://threatdragon.org/login). This is on older version which is due to be
updated soon, and the notable difference is that we now have a dekstop version that can be installed on linux - along
with Windows and MacOS.
