## What is Threat Dragon?

OWASP Threat Dragon is a modeling tool used to create threat model diagrams as part of a secure development lifecycle.
Threat Dragon follows the values and principles of the [threat modeling manifesto](https://www.threatmodelingmanifesto.org/).
It can be used to record possible threats and decide on their mitigations, as well as giving a visual indication
of the threat model components and threat surfaces. Threat Dragon runs either as a web application or a desktop application.

Threat Dragon supports STRIDE / LINDDUN / CIA, provides modeling diagrams and implements a rule engine to auto-generate
threats and their mitigations.

Use the [documentation](https://threatdragon.github.io) to get started, along with the recording of Mike Goodwin
giving a [lightning demo](https://youtu.be/n6JGcZGFq5o) during the OWASP Open Security Summit in June 2020.

Threat Dragon has a [demonstration page](https://threatdragon.org/login). This is on older version which is due to be
updated soon, and the notable difference is that we now have a desktop version that can be installed on Linux - along
with Windows and MacOS.
