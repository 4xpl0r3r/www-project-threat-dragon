Threat modeling is widely regarded as a powerful way to build security into the design of applications and systems
early in a secure development lifecycle.
At its best, threat modeling is especially good for:

* Ensuring defence-in-depth
* Establishing consistent security design patterns across an application
* Flushing out security requirements and user stories

OWASP Threat Dragon provides a free, open-source, threat modeling application that is powerful and easy to use.
It can be used for categorising threats using STRIDE, [LINDDUN](https://www.linddun.org/) and CIA.
The key areas of focus for the tool is:

* Simplicity - you can install and start using Threat Dragon very quickly
* Flexibility - the diagramming and threat generation allows all types of threat to be described
* Accessibility - different types of teams can benefit from Threat Dragon's simplicity and flexibility
