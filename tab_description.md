Threat modelling is widely regarded as a powerful way to build security into the design of applications early in a secure development lifecycle.
At its best, it is especially good for
* Ensuring defence-in-depth
* Establishing consistent security design patterns across an application
* Flushing out security requirements and user stories

OWASP Threat Dragon provides a free, open-source, threat modelling application for teams implementing the STRIDE approach.
It can also be used for categorising threats using LINDDUN and CIA.
The key areas of focus for the tool is:
* Great UX - using Threat Dragon should be simple, engaging and fun
* A powerful threat/mitigation rule engine - this lowers the barrier to entry for teams and allow non-specialists to contribute
* Integration points with other development lifecycle tools - when implemented this will ensure that models slot easily into the development lifecycle and remain relevant as the project evolves
