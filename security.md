## Security Policy

It is not impossible that a malicious actor could somehow embed malware in the markdown or subvert the scripts for this project. 
If you find anything suspicious in this Threat Dragon site then please let us know ASAP and we will fix it as a priority.

Ideally open a [security advisory][advisory] and this will be provided only to the project's admins in strict confidence.

Alternatively send an encrypted email to [Jon Gadsden][mail] to start the secure disclosure process.
