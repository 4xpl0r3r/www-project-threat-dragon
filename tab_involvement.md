#### Testers
Easy user experience is one of the key goals for the project and to get that right it needs more users!
If you would like to try the tool out, the released versions are
on the [web application github](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon/releases).

The desktop variant has installers for Linux, Windows and MacOS which be downloaded from the
[desktop project github](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-desktop/releases).

To help you get started, take a look at the [documentaion area](https://threatdragon.github.io).

If you are still having problems, let us know and we will be pleased to help (mike.goodwin@owasp.org and 
jon.gadsden@owasp.org). All feedback is very welcome, so either email us or add an issue on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-core/issues).

#### Coding
Coding help of any kind is always welcome. The project builds easily (let us know if you have any problems)
so getting up and running should be simple.  There are some
[developer notes](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-core/blob/main/dev-notes.md) in the core
[threat dragon](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon-core) repo to help get started with this project.

#### Threat rule engine
If you are not into javascript, you can still help! We want to create a powerful threat generation rule engine
to enhance the one that is in place for the early releases. If you can contribute in this area by
defining rules, that would be great.
