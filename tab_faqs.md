## FAQs
Q1: Hold on...isn't this the same as Mozilla's SeaSponge?

A1: As I was working on prototyping this, mostly as a way of getting myself properly up to speed with javascript,
I found out about SeaSponge via the OWASP leaders mailing list. SeaSponge has a lot in common with this project
and I based my implementation of the threat model file download feature on theirs. Maybe they could be merged in
the future? Who knows?

Q2: What browsers can be used for Threat Dragon?

A2: Threat Dragon has been tested on these browsers, but there are certainly more.
