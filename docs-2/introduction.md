## [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org) Threat Dragon

[Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) is an open-source threat modelling tool from OWASP.
It comes as a web application or an Electron based installable desktop app for MacOS, Windows and Linux.

The web application can store threat model files on the local filesystem; in addition access can be configured for :

- GitHub
- Bitbucket
- GitLab
- Github Enterprise

The desktop app saves your threat models on your local file system only, repository access is a future enhancement.

You can find the source code for Threat Dragon on [GitHub][repo],
where you can also ask for changes or report any issues.
